One key difference between the two is that a grocery store typically sells a wider variety of items, including non-food items like household cleaning supplies and personal care products, while a farmer's market focuses exclusively on food items. Additionally, the prices at a grocery store are often lower than at a farmer's market due to the economies of scale achieved through mass production and distribution.
