Secondly, recycling reduces the amount of waste sent to landfills, which can pollute the environment and contribute to climate change. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, recycling helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 117 million metric tons, which is equivalent to removing 23 million cars from the road. Finally, recycling can create jobs and stimulate economic growth. In the United States alone, the recycling industry generates over $117 billion in economic activity and creates more than 500,000 jobs.
